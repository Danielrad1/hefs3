# What Does "Suspend" Mean?

## TL;DR
**Suspend = Pause** - Cards won't appear in study sessions until you unsuspend them.

## Full Explanation

### 📚 What Suspend Does

When you **suspend** a card:
- ✅ Card is **hidden from study queue**
- ✅ Card **stays in your deck** (not deleted)
- ✅ All progress/history is **preserved**
- ✅ Card **won't count toward "due today"**
- ✅ You can **unsuspend anytime** to resume studying

### 🎯 Why Use Suspend?

**Common use cases:**

1. **Too difficult right now**
   - "This anatomy card is too advanced, I'll come back after basics"
   - Suspend it, study easier cards first

2. **Outdated information**
   - "This fact changed, I need to update it"
   - Suspend while you research the correct info

3. **Temporarily irrelevant**
   - "I don't need French vocab right now, focusing on Spanish"
   - Suspend the French deck

4. **Duplicates**
   - "I have two cards for the same thing"
   - Suspend one until you decide which to keep

5. **Overwhelming deck**
   - "100 cards due is too much!"
   - Suspend some to focus on the most important ones

### 🔄 Suspend vs Delete

| Action | Effect | Use When |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Suspend** | Pauses card, keeps all data | Temporary - might need it later |
| **Delete** | Removes card permanently | Card is wrong/useless forever |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Suspend strategically**: Focus your study sessions on what matters most right now
- **Review suspended cards**: Periodically browse suspended cards to see if you're ready to unsuspend
- **Tag before suspending**: Tag cards with why you suspended them (e.g., "too-hard", "needs-update")
- **Suspend whole decks**: Use "Suspend All Cards" in Deck Detail to pause an entire subject
